                'The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which causes shorter wavelengths of 
                light (blue) to scatter more than longer wavelengths (red) sources[0]. This scattering causes the sky to look blue most of 
                the time sources[0]. Additionally, during sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red or orange because the light has to 
                pass through more atmosphere, scattering the shorter blue wavelengths out of the line of sight and allowing the 
                longer red wavelengths to dominate sources[1].'
